It is a real-time board game, which means there are no turns. Indeed, even pausing too long to think of your next move can be dangerous.</p><p>After the initial design, the game went through a rigorous play testing process. Both the board layout and pawn design evolved a great deal through observing play sessions, and the goals were revised and tweaked to ensure balanced play.</p>"
