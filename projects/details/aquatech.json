		"content":"<p>This was a conceptual project to design a kiosk to enhance a public space in some way. Our design places a kiosk at the SouthSide Works fountain in Pittsburgh, PA, offering control of the fountain's actions, as well as using environmental sensors to respond to people's direct interaction with the fountain itself. This would make the fountain more of a community attraction, encouraging people to gather and interact with each other as well as the fountain.</p>"
